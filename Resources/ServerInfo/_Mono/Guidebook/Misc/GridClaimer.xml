  Sometimes, you might want to make a wreck or an asteroid into your new home.
  Unfortunately, if you try to do just that, you will find that if you go away from it, it will very likely get permanently lost.

  Banners can help you avoid that.
  Interact with the banner to claim the grid (make sure the banner is anchored and stays anchored!), preventing it from despawning even when you go away.
  If you're done with the grid, interact with the banner again.

  The following grids may be claimed:
  - Event grids (VGroids, unidentified vessels, etc.)
  - Debris
  - Asteroids
